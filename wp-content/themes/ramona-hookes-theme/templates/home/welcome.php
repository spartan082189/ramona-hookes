      <p>
        In a effort to develop Dominion Cathedral Ministries Foreign Mission ministry, Dominion Restoration Ministries have decided to adopt Ramona Hookes Memorial Institute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ramona Hookes Memorial Institute is a school that is built to help poor parents and guardians who are unable to send their children to school.
      </p>
      <p>
        This school will be absolutely free to the public. There will be quality education offered here free of charge, your responsibility as parent or
        guardian is to just send your children to school and leave the rest with us. We will be working indirect consultation with the Ministry of
        Education by following the requisite curriculum.
